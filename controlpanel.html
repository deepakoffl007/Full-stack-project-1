            <h3 class="ha">From Design to Delivery</h3>
            <p class="p1">Our inventive team is focused on Error Minimization—we create a 3D model, in executable file format, of each client’s control panel before production begins. The model includes control panel wiring, routing schemes and low voltage/analog signals. This minimizes any potential EMC or analog signal interference problem.</p>
            <p class="p2">The engineers at RAM Automation offer control panel solutions from concept to design and fabrication. We can design an electrical schematic in JIC or IEC topology, and download any necessary software/parameters to ensure that each system has the highest functioning quality. Our engineers and programmers can even create custom test fixtures or load generators to verify circuit functionality.</p>
            <p class="p3">All control panels are 100% tested for quality. We measure quality by using DMAIC, FMEA & DFMEA matrix tools.</p>
